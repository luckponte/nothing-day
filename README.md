# nothing-day
Little activity scheduler for a "Nothing day": a day that is not a dedicated holiday or a special date that you select to surprise your loved ones.

It can be an activity or a reminder for a little gift, but whatever it is, use to make your loved one's lives a bit more colourful and surprising.
